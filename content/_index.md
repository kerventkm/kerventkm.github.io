        My research focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of decision trees and decision rule systems. I investigate the relationships between these fundamental structures in machine learning and their applications in real-world scenarios.

        Currently, I am working on:
        - Analyzing the complexity relationships between decision trees and decision rule systems
        - Developing efficient algorithms for transforming between different decision system representations
        - Applying graph neural networks to geological problems in collaboration with Saudi Aramco
        
        I am always open to collaborations and discussions about research in machine learning, decision systems, and graph neural networks. Feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
