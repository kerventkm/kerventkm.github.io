## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), specializing in decision trees, machine learning, deep learning, and graph theory. My research focuses on the relationships between decision trees and decision rule systems, under the supervision of Prof. Mikhail Moshkov.

With an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics, I bring a strong mathematical foundation to my research in AI and machine learning. I have industry experience through internships at Saudi Aramco's AI and Advanced Computing Department, where I worked on applying Graph Neural Networks to geological problems.

I am passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge, currently serving as an instructor and teaching assistant at KAUST Academy for various AI and mathematics courses. My research has led to several publications in the fields of decision trees, rule systems, and graph neural networks.
